## Usage

### Basic Concepts

There are three basic concepts (entities) in OpenSCAP plug-in: SCAP Contents, Compliance
Policies and ARF Reports.

*SCAP Content* represents SCAP DataStream XML file as defined by SCAP 1.2 standard. Datastream
file contains implementation of compliance, configuration or security baselines. Users are
advised to acquire examplary baseline by installing scap-security-guide package. DataStream
file usualy contains multiple XCCDF Profiles. Each for different security target. The content
of Datastream file can be inspected by `oscap` tool from openscap-scanner package.

  ```
  # yum install -y scap-security-guide openscap-scanner
  # oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml
  # oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml
  ```

*Compliance Policy* is highlevel concept of a baseline applied to the infrastructure. Compliance
Policy is defined by user on web interface. User may assign following information to the Policy:
+ SCAP Content
+ XCCDF Profile from particular SCAP Content
+ Host Groups that should comply with the policy
+ Schedule - the period in which the audit shall occur

*ARF Report* is XML output of single scan occurance per single host. Asset Reporting File format
is defined by SCAP 1.2 standard. Foreman plug-in stores the ARF Reports in database for later
inspections.

### User Interface

The most of the Foreman-OpenSCAP controls are located in the *Compliance* section under the *Host*
menu. The section contains three items as described in previous section: SCAP Contents, Compliance
Policies, ARF Reports.

### Prerequisites before the first use

Make sure that
1. smart_proxy_openscap and puppet-foreman_scap_client packages are installed on your proxies
2. proxies have Foreman uri defined
  ```
  # echo ':foreman_url: https://foreman17.local.lan' >> /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
  ```
3. foreman_scap_client puppet class is imported to your Foreman
  1. Go to Configure -> Puppet classes page
  2. Click Import button
  3. Select foreman_scap_client

### Setting-up first compliance policy

1. Log-in to Web Interface
2. Create new SCAP Content
  1. Go to *Hosts -> Compliance -> SCAP contents* page
  2. Upload DataSteam file
3. Create new Policy
  1. Go to Hosts -> Compliance -> Policies page
  2. Assign SCAP Content to Policy
  3. Select Profile from your SCAP Content
  4. Define periodic scan schedule
  5. Assign Hostgroups to the policy (hosts you want to audit should be assigned with one of the
     hostgroups)
4. Select particular hosts for compliance audit
  1. Go to *Hosts -> All hosts* page
  2. Select hosts
  3. Use *Select Action -> Assign Compliance Policy* button
5. Make sure the DataStream file is present on the clients' file system.

   At the moment, Foreman infrastructure is not able to serve a file to the clients. Hence, users
   are required to distribute their DataStrem file to each client. The expected location is
   defined at *Compliance Policy -> Edit* dialogue.
6. Inspect the compliance results
  1. Go to *Hosts -> Compliance -> Reports* page
  2. Wait for ARF Reports to show-up
  3. Go to *Hosts -> Compliance -> Policies* page
  4. Click the policy link to view dashboard and trend
